# 📝 Persisting the To-Do Checked Status

A simple, lightweight To-Do List web app built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
It allows you to add, mark, and remove tasks, with the **checked status persisted in the browser’s local storage** so your progress is saved even after you refresh or reopen the page.

- Add new tasks to your to-do list.
- Mark tasks as completed by checking them.
- Remove tasks you no longer need.
- Automatically **save the checked/unchecked status** using `localStorage`.
- Works entirely in the browser — **no backend required**.
